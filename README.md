# QPROP_AeroTableGenerator
Generate aerodynamic data from QPROP runs in MATLAB

This code will run QPROP through a user specified run to generate aerodynamic data for a propeller. The "PropellerAeroTableGenerator" script walks the user through the creation of a propeller geometry file using the QPROP_GeomGen.m file and analysis of the propeller. Visualization is performed afterwards.

This code can be used to generate lookup tables for simulation of aircraft.
